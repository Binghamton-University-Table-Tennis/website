<p1><b>2.5 DEFINITIONS</b></br></p1>
<b>2.5.1</b> A rally is the period during which the ball is in play.</br>
<b>2.5.2</b> The ball is in play from the last moment at which it is stationary on the palm of
the free hand before being intentionally projected in service until the rally is
decided as a let or a point.</br>
<b>2.5.3</b> A let is a rally of which the result is not scored.</br>
<b>2.5.4</b> A point is a rally of which the result is scored.</br>
<b>2.5.5</b> The racket hand is the hand carrying the racket.</br>
<b>2.5.6</b> The free hand is the hand not carrying the racket; the free arm is the arm of the
free hand.</br>
<b>2.5.7</b> A player strikes the ball if he or she touches it in play with his or her racket, held
in the hand, or with his or her racket hand below the wrist.</br>
<b>2.5.8</b> A player obstructs the ball if he or she, or anything he or she wears or carries,
touches it in play when it is above or travelling towards the playing surface, not
having touched his or her court since last being struck by his or her opponent.</br>
<b>2.5.9</b> The server is the player due to strike the ball first in a rally.</br>
<b>2.5.10</b> The receiver is the player due to strike the ball second in a rally.</br>

decisions.</br>

wearing or carrying, other than the ball, at the start of the rally.</br>
<b>2.5.14</b> The end line shall be regarded as extending indefinitely in both directions.</br></br>
<p1><b>2.6 THE SERVICE</b></br></p1>
<b>2.6.1</b> Service shall start with the ball resting freely on the open palm of the server's
stationary free hand.</br>
<b>2.6.2</b> The server shall then project the ball near vertically upwards, without imparting
spin, so that it rises at least 16cm after leaving the palm of the free hand and
then falls without touching anything before being struck.</br>
<b>2.6.3</b> As the ball is falling the server shall strike it so that it touches first his or her
court and then touches directly the receiver's court; in doubles, the ball shall
touch successively the right half court of server and receiver.</br>
<b>2.6.4</b> From the start of service until it is struck, the ball shall be above the level of the
playing surface and behind the server's end line, and it shall not be hidden from
the receiver by the server or his or her doubles partner or by anything they wear
or carry.</br>
<b>2.6.5</b> As soon as the ball has been projected, the server’s free arm and hand shall
be removed from the space between the ball and the net.</br>
The space between the ball and the net is defined by the ball, the net and its
indefinite upward extension.<br>
<b>2.6.6</b> It is the responsibility of the player to serve so that the umpire or the assistant
umpire can be satisfied that he or she complies with the requirements of the
Laws, and either may decide that a service is incorrect.<br>
<b>2.6.6.1</b> If either the umpire or the assistant umpire is not sure about the legality of
a service he or she may, on the first occasion in a match, interrupt play and
warn the server; but any subsequent service by that player or his or her
doubles partner which is not clearly legal shall be considered incorrect.<br>
<b>2.6.7</b> Exceptionally, the umpire may relax the requirements for a correct service
where he or she is satisfied that compliance is prevented by physical disability.<br>
<p1><br><b>2.7 THE RETURN</b><br></p1>
<b>2.7.1</b> The ball, having been served or returned, shall be struck so that it touches the
opponent's court, either directly or after touching the net assembly.<br>

return and thereafter server and receiver alternately shall each make a return.<br>

the receiver shall then make a return, the partner of the server shall then make
a return, the partner of the receiver shall then make a return and thereafter each
player in turn in that sequence shall make a return.<br>
<b>2.8.3</b> In doubles, when at least one player of a pair is in a wheelchair due to a physical
disability, the server shall first make a service, the receiver shall then make a
return but thereafter either player of the disabled pair may make returns.
However, no part of a player’s wheelchair nor a foot of a standing player of this
pair shall protrude beyond the imaginary extension of the centre line of the
table. If it does, the umpire shall award the point to the opposing pair.<br>

otherwise correct or the ball is obstructed by the receiver or his or her

provided that neither the receiver nor his or her partner attempts to strike
